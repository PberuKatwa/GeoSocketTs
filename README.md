# GeoSocketTs
GeoSocketTs is an open-source real-time tracking demo built with Vue 3, Node.js, and TypeScript. It demonstrates how modern delivery apps (e.g., Uber Eats, Glovo, Bolt Food) track drivers by simulating movement and streaming live location updates via WebSockets, using MapLibre GL for visualization and Turf.js for geospatial calculations.
